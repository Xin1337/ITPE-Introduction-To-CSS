    <p class="box output">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It is a fundamental technology for creating websites and web applications. HTML is used to structure and format content, add multimedia components such as images and videos, and create links between web pages. It provides a simple and straightforward way to create and publish web pages that are easily accessible and viewable by anyone with an internet connection. HTML is constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of the web, and new versions are regularly released with new features and capabilities.

        HTML is an essential technology for anyone looking to create web content. It allows you to structure your content in a meaningful way, making it easier for search engines to find and index your pages. By using HTML, you can create pages that are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies to access the web. Additionally, HTML is the foundation for more advanced web development technologies, such as CSS and JavaScript, which enable you to create interactive and dynamic web pages. Whether you're a blogger, a business owner, or a professional web developer, HTML is an essential tool for creating effective and engaging web content.</p>

    <p class="box output">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages. It allows web designers and developers to control the visual design of their pages, including fonts, colors, and layout, separate from the content itself. CSS is a critical technology in modern web development because it allows designers to create pages that are both visually appealing and easy to use. With CSS, you can control the layout and appearance of your pages across multiple devices, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.

        CSS is important because it allows you to create visually appealing and functional web pages. It enables you to customize the design of your pages to meet the specific needs of your audience. By separating the presentation of your content from the content itself, CSS makes it easier to update and modify the design of your pages without changing the content. This allows you to create more engaging and dynamic web experiences for your users. CSS is a core technology in modern web development, and is used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create powerful and engaging web applications. Whether you're creating a simple blog or a complex web application, CSS is an essential tool for creating web content that is both functional and visually appealing.</p>
